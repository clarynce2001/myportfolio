		<h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
		<p>I'm Clarynce M. Caparos, 22 years old from the Municipality of Tudela. I was born on February 26, 2001. I'm fond of reading books, watching horror films, dancing, and listening to music. I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift. I am currently taking up Bachelor of Industrial Technology - Major in Computer Technology in Cebu Technological University - San Francisco Campus. I am also part of Supreme Student Government of CTU-San Francisco Campus as a Multimedia Director. In addition to that, I am also the class mayor of BIT-CT 3C.</p>
		
		<p> I am a keen reader of horror/thriller novels as well as an avid fan of related genre of films and movies. My zodiac sign is Pisces which denotes that I am a creative, imaginative and a sensitive human being. I hate wearing vividly colored clothing, I am more on faded and minimal type of a person. I do also love to organize things.</p>
		
		<p>I am a very adventurous person too and most likely to take risk if I needed to. I like to do creative stuff besides doing old routine again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I also find myself strongly interested in photography, editing videos and photos. Regarding with my current plan in life, there's nothing much that I can say but to pursue my studies and hopefully, get this degree in God's will.</p>
